# Thai Election 69 Correlative Analyzer

An analytical tool designed to scrape and evaluate Thai election data, inspired by the correlation observations shared by [Khajochi's Blog](https://www.facebook.com/KhajochiBlog/posts/pfbid02qyYXY3NH7zns1gr3Emhdcij48y8UFQg3htvXYHRgfaDosjhQzytHapCAAj3bLhgl).

This project investigates the relationship between Constituency MP candidate numbers and Party List rankings across various election districts.

## 📊 Project Overview

The analyzer performs two primary functions:
1. **Data Acquisition**: Automates the collection of unofficial election results (Constituency and Party List) from the Thai PBS platform.
2. **Correlation Analysis**: Compares the winning MP's candidate number against the top 7 rankings of the Party List to identify statistical overlaps or trends.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Efficient Scraping**: Utilizes direct JSON API endpoints for high-speed data retrieval.
- **Province Jumps**: Implements intelligent area-code skipping to avoid redundant requests for invalid districts.
- **Dynamic Aggregation**: Summarizes outcomes by party, providing a sorted overview of where candidate-party number matches occur most frequently.
- **Custom Filters**: Automatically excludes specific party codes (e.g., 06 and 09) from the analysis to focus on relevant variables.

## 🛠️ Installation

Ensure you have Python 3.12+ installed.

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/election_69_analyzer.git
   cd election_69_analyzer
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install requests
   ```

## 📖 Usage

The analysis is performed in two sequential steps:

### 1. Data Collection (if raw data updating is needed)
Execute the scraper to download the latest unofficial results from Thai PBS. This process builds a local database in the `data/` directory.
```bash
python scripts/election_scraper.py
```
*Note: This process may take 5–10 minutes depending on network conditions.*

### 2. Statistical Comparison
Run the comparer to analyze the correlation between winning MP numbers and the top 7 Party List results.
```bash
python scripts/mp_pl_comparer.py
```

## 📝 Methodology
The analyzer extracts the "MP Number" from the `candidateCode` of the winning constituency candidate. It then checks if that number matches the last two digits of any `partyCode` ranked #1 through #7 in the Party List for that same area. 

By default, parties **06 (United Thai Nation Party)** and **09 (Pheu Thai Party)** are excluded from the comparison to reduce known statistical bias.
